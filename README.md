# XPOCx
📚 A curated collection of advanced Python concepts, patterns, and real-world implementations. This repository documents my journey through Python’s deeper features—metaclasses, decorators, concurrency, performance optimization, and more.

Each module includes:

    Commented code with explanations

    Practical examples (e.g., async/await, context managers, descriptors)

    Benchmarks and best practices

🔧 Topics Covered:
✔️ OOP deep dives (__slots__, ABCs, operator overloading)
✔️ Concurrency (asyncio, threading vs multiprocessing)
✔️ Metaprogramming (decorators, metaclasses, dynamic imports)
✔️ Performance tricks (memoryview, functools.lru_cache, Cython)
✔️ Python internals (GIL, garbage collection, bytecode)
